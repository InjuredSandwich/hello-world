# hello-world
I'm doing this again to give myself some more experience and lock in what I learned. 
This seems like it's a nice, neat system, but the UI could be more intuitive. Heh, seems to be a trend in programming. I'll probably get used to it and enjoy how fast it is to use compared to something that's easier to learn and visualize, but takes longer to click around in. 
Thanks github for this cool site. I still have almost 0% understanding of what programming is like, or how programmers use this service, and if this service is the only of its kind. But all that's okay. We're going.
